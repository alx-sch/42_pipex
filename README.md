Pipex mimics the functionality of the shell pipe command '` | `' : Executing `./pipex infile cmd1 cmd2 outfile` emulates the behavior of `< infile cmd1 | cmd2 > outfile`. It facilitates the connection of the standard output of one command to the standard input of another command, creating a pipeline for data flow between commands executed within separate processes.

## Features
- **Command Execution:** Utilizing the PATH environmental variable to execute commands via `execve()`.
- **Process Management:** Creating new child processes and establishing inter-process communication via `fork()`, `pipe()`, `dup2()`, and `waitpid()`.
- **Error Handling:** Ensuring robustness by implementing mechanisms to protect the program from unexpected behavior and failure, using `perror()`, `strerror()`, and `errno`.
- **Imitating Shell Behavior:** Replicating the behavior of the shell (zsh) as closely as possible.

## Command Execution

### The PATH Environmental Variable

Environmental variables, essential elements of the operating system's environment, store information utilized by various processes and applications to configure their behavior and access system resources.

For example, commands such as 'grep', 'ls', or 'cat' all reside within the system as executable files. To determine the exact path(s) to a specific command, you can use `which` followed by the command name, such as `which grep` or `which ls` (there might be more than one location where the executable is stored).

When calling a command, the terminal shell checks the PATH environment variable. This variable contains a list of directories where the operating system searches to find the executable file corresponding to the given command.

To view a list of all environmental variables and their values, you can execute the `env` command in the terminal. This command displays a list like this (excerpt):

```bash
[...]
LANGUAGE=en
USER=aschenk
SHELL=/bin/zsh
[...]
PATH=/home/aschenk/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin
```

You can access the list of environmental variables within your C program by including `char **env` as an argument to the main function. For example: `int main(int argc, char **argv, char **env)`.


To understand how Pipex retrieves the path to a specified command, please refer to the [get_command_path() function] (https://github.com/alx-sch/42_pipex/blob/main/src/call_cmd.c).

### The Execve() System Call


execve â€” execute with vector of environment variables


## Pipex vs Shell

Using Z Shell (zsh).

Comparison (output shell + output pipex):

#### Invalid Input on Left Side
- single invalid input:
	- infile not existent
 	- infile no access
  	- invalid command
  	- invalid command option
  	- infile not existent & invalid command

	- Note: The color-coded output signals 'success' (blue)! -> left side is handled in a process that does NOT report the EXIT status to the parten.
  	- Note: If multiple invalid comments: Only the file-related issue is addressed, not the invalid command -> process exits after file access fails.
  	- Note: An empty outfile.txt is created ('rw-r--r-- permissions) even if the pipe call failed.

#### Invalid Input on Right Side   
- Same as above for the left side BUT color-coded output signals 'error' (red) -> right side is handled in a process that reports EXIT status to partent.

#### Invalid Input on Both Sides
- Same as above, error messages for both sides are printed out -> processes handling each side run paralelly; having one exit does not result in the other process not being executed.

#### Proccesses run parallely
- no sleep

- wait 10 microseconds before calling pipeline_right()

- wait 100 microseconds before calling pipeline_right()

#### Same file as input and output
- Let's say you want to count the words in a file and store the results in another, but use the same file as input and output `< infile.txt wc -w | cat > infile.txt`, the result would be file with '0' in it -> The 'outfile' is created first as an empty file (overwriting the actual 'infile') and THEN process are initiated.

#### Parent waits for the last process to finish
- `< infile.txt | head > outfile.txt` `./pipex infile.txt yes head outfile.txt `
